Wrapper Class:
    - we have been using primitive types but there are occasions we to
    - represent them as wrapper class
    - wrapper class is the one which contains or wraps the primitive type
    - All primitive type has wrapper classes

The working of both the methods is give below:
1. Compare() 
    - Comparing chars using compare which returns int
    - It return 0 if char1==char2 else if(char1<char2) then less than 0 otherwise greater than 0.
2. compareTo()
    - Comparing Character objects using compareTo which returns int
        - if returns 0 if obj1==obj2.
        - a value less than 0 if obj1<obj2.
        - a value greater than 0 if obj1>obj2.
